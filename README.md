## 🚖 Uber Ride Analytics 2024 – Data-Driven Insights 📊

I recently worked on analyzing the Uber Ride Analytics Dataset (2024) containing 150,000+ rides. This project gave me an opportunity to explore booking behaviors, cancellations, revenue streams, and customer satisfaction metrics.

## 🔑 Key Highlights:
📈 Total Bookings: 148.77K rides with a 65.96% success rate
❌ Cancellations: ~25% of rides (Customer: 19.15%, Driver: 7.45%)
💳 Top Revenue Source: UPI (~40% of total revenue) followed by Cash (~25%)
⭐ Ratings: Customers rated rides higher (avg. ~4.40) than drivers (avg. ~4.23)
🚗 Vehicle Insights: Go Sedan had the highest customer ratings, while UberXL drivers were the most satisfied.
## 🔍 Cancellation Insights:
Customer Reasons: Wrong address (22.5%), driver issues (22.4%), and app issues (11%).
Driver Reasons: Capacity issues (25%), customer-related issues (25.3%), and personal/car issues (24.9%).

## 🤖 Predictive Modeling:
 I trained multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, XGBoost) to predict Booking Status.
 
📊 Result: All models achieved ~100% accuracy after preprocessing and feature engineering.

💡 Takeaway:
 This project reinforced the power of data analytics in mobility services. By combining exploratory data analysis, visualization, and machine learning, businesses like Uber can optimize operations, reduce cancellations, and enhance customer experiences.
